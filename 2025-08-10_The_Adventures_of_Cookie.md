## Chapter 1

There once was a stray tuxedo cat in Gabrovo, Bulgaria. The cat's name was Cookie and her life was hard. She scavenged for food and water that was either dirty or had bugs in it.

But one day when she was sharing a piece of rotten mouse with her best friend Biscuit, who was an orange tom, Cookie said do you ever wonder where our parents are? Biscuit said no, I lost my mom when I saw a crow outside and when I came back my mom and siblings where gone. Oh said cookie. Well, I don't know how I lost my parents, but if I find them I can have a better life and I will have brothers and sisters. Doesn't that sound great to you?

Not really, we already have nice food and water and a shelter. Not really said cookie, spiting a piece of the mouse to the ground because there was a worm inside. We have bad food, dirty water and our shelter is under a car. I think we should go and try to find my parents and siblings.

No, I just want to stay here and sleep Biscuit said sleepily. And plus, we will be going into dog territory and we're at war with them so that won't be good.

Well, said cookie looking at a map a human dropped, we could try to go through the Dogan Forest up north.

WHAT! said biscuit are you crazy? Every animal that went in there never came back!

Exactly! said cookie excitedly, so there will be no dogs guarding it. I'm not so sure this is a good idea. How do we even know your family is past dog territory?

Because, I remember being chased out of my little nest by a huge dog and I could only see a big black and white cat saying: Run cookie run! we will meet again just run! And when we are in the Dogan Forest we can look at what the dogs are doing and after tell it to White Eye, the leader of the cats and we can live with him, all together. And he gets fresh mouse every day and the cleanest water and sometimes even milk! Cookie said even more exited. Wow said biscuit dreaming of all the snacks he would get.

OK, we should go first thing in the morning! But first we need sleep.

## Chapter 2

At ten in the morning, Cookie woke Biscuit up. Let me rest, Biscuit said, still half asleep.

_Come on_, Cookie said, running around in circles as if she just had catnip. Wake up sleepy head! We have to go to Carmel Leaf to pick up some catnip and anti-worm pills.

Ok, just give me one more hour to sleep.

Hey, look its a big juicy bird, and its not even flying!

Biscuit woke up and his pupils became almost as big as his eyes. Where where?

It was just a trick to get you to stop sleeping. Now come!

Annoyed, Biscuit hissed and said, ok but NEVER joke about stuff like that, ok?

Cookie rolled her eyes, then said yeah yeah. Ok, lets go.

The two cats went to a huge calico with a scar on his paw. What do you want? The calico said grumpily.

Two anti worm pills and a medium size bag of catnip said Cookie a little scared.

Ok, that will be three clean mouses and two pigeons, said the grumpy calico.

Don't you think thats a lot just for 2 pills and catnip Carmel Leaf, Biscuit asked surprised.

Well its been getting harder to sneak in to those humans houses and sometimes, I get caught.

Well, we have to give him our emergency food, but I guess it's worth it Cookie said sadly.

A few minuets later they came back with there food and paid.

"Alright," said Cookie. Lets go!

Wait, said Carmel Leaf. Are you going to the Dogan forest?

Yeah, Biscuit said sniffing the worm pills. So? Its not like theres monsters there.

Oh there is, Carmel Leaf said loudly. There's terrible monsters there. I myself have been in there and I almost died. I could hear a loud screeching sound and about 6 huge things bigger than dogs came pouncing at me. I barley escaped.

Biscuit could tell Cookie was scarred of Carmel Leafs story so he whispered to Cookie, don't worry Carmel Leaf is pretty old and makes up a lot of stuff. Remember when he said that he saw aliens take over the world?

That made Cookie feel better. After that they went to the Dogan forest but they heard something in a bush. Biscuit went a little closer to the bush but then something jumped out.

## Chapter 3

Cookie and Biscuit both screamed.

Cookie jumped on to the animal and scratched,bit and hissed.

The animal threw Cookie of and growled. It was a Australian Shepard! It came closer and closer to Cookie and Biscuit.

Pleas don't hurt us Biscuit said, my friend did not mean to hurt you.

I did mean to hurt him Cookie said looking at the dog, i meant to do as much pain as i could.

shhhh your not helping Cookie, whispered Biscuit

Grrrr how dare you come in dog territory growled the big dog.

I thought they where no dogs in the Dogan forest Biscuit said confused.

Your right growled the Dog, I was the king of the dog's hunter. But one day i could not find any food so as punishment i had to stay in the Dogan forest for a week. But now that i found you two kitty's Lord Brown Ear will thank me and i will be his hunter again.

We are not kitties hissed cookie.

Just come here and i will take you to Death cage the dog prison the dog said still growling, follow me.

Cookie and Biscuit followed the huge dog out of the forest and to a huge black dog bigger than the Australian shepard.

Large Tail! I told you to come back after a week in the Dogan forest the huge dog said angrily.

But Brown Ear i brought intruders for you!

_yea_ of course you did. No cat would be dumb enough to go to the Dogan forest. Look after you spend a week in the forest you can be my hunter.

No its true look. The two cats came out of behind Large Tail's back.

Well look what we have here two cats walking in dog lands. Guards send them to the death cage. And Large Tail because you found them you can be the prison guard.

## Chapter 4

Two long dalmatians lead the two cats to a small metal cage filed with dirt and mud.

Get in here one dalmatian growled.

Wait this is our cell? Cookie said when she and Biscuit went in the small cage.

This is horrible Biscuit said. Im also hungry he said grumpily

Well we can have those worm pills Cookie said looking at the cage, who knows what kind od. stuff these dogs have. And the cage looks even worse than the dogs!

Both Cookie and Biscuit took a pill. These taste disgusting Biscuit said.

Yea Cookie said. We should also clean ourselves at least that does not taste disgusting.

After about 7 Minuit's of cleaning them selfs Cookie noticed that Large Tail was guarding the cage.

Hey Large Tail! Cookie said in a friendly voice, help us get out of here.

Hahahaha _yea_ and get me sent to the Dogan forest for a year Large tail said.

But pleas Large Tail we want to find my mom cookie said purring next to large Tail.

Look Australian shepard's are smart dogs and im not going to let you two cats escape.

Large Tail!!! the big brown dog was calling, Sorry kitties I need to do important business. Get some rest its late.

A few minuit's later Large Tail came to Brown ear. Yes Lord Brown Ear what do you need.

Oh nothing i just wanted to say that at eight in the morning your going to go back Brown Ear said.

Go where? Large Tail said confused.

Back to the forest of course!

What! Large Tail said mad, But i brought you prisoners!

Exactly! which is why you i reduced your punishment to 6 days not 7! Brown ear said haply.

No im not doing that! Large Tail said furious

Brown Ear's smile went to a frown, ok if you don't want to go in the forest go in the death cage!

Sorry my Lord i should have never done that Large Tail said still a little mad but holding it in.

Good now get some sleep Brown Ear said calming down.

After that Large Tail went to the two cats in the death cage. Wake up he said

Why? Biscuit said a little mad he was woken up.

We are going to get out of this place Large Tail said proudly

## Chapter 5

Cookie and Biscuit where both exited to hear that and were running around.

Shhhh Large Tail said, don't wake the dogs up!

Ok said Cookie still exited, Whats the plan to escape?
