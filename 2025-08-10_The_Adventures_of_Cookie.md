## Chapter 1

There once was a stray tuxedo cat in Gabrovo, Bulgaria. The cat's name was Cookie and her life was hard. She scavenged for food and water that was either dirty or had bugs in it.

But one day when she was sharing a piece of rotten mouse with her best friend Biscuit, who was an orange tom, Cookie said do you ever wonder where our parents are? Biscuit said no, I lost my mom when I saw a crow outside and when I came back my mom and siblings where gone. Oh said cookie. Well, I don't know how I lost my parents, but if I find them I can have a better life and I will have brothers and sisters. Doesn't that sound great to you?

Not really, we already have nice food and water and a shelter. Not really said cookie, spiting a piece of the mouse to the ground because there was a worm inside. We have bad food, dirty water and our shelter is under a car. I think we should go and try to find my parents and siblings.

No, I just want to stay here and sleep Biscuit said sleepily. And plus, we will be going into dog territory and we're at war with them so that won't be good.

Well, said cookie looking at a map a human dropped, we could try to go through the Dogan Forest up north.

WHAT! said biscuit are you crazy? Every animal that went in there never came back!

Exactly! said cookie excitedly, so there will be no dogs guarding it. I'm not so sure this is a good idea. How do we even know your family is past dog territory?

Because, I remember being chased out of my little nest by a huge dog and I could only see a big black and white cat saying: Run cookie run! we will meet again just run! And when we are in the Dogan Forest we can look at what the dogs are doing and after tell it to White Eye, the leader of the cats and we can live with him, all together. And he gets fresh mouse every day and the cleanest water and sometimes even milk! Wow said biscuit dreaming of all the snacks he would get.

OK, we should go first thing in the morning! But first we need sleep.

## Chapter 2

At ten in the morning, Cookie woke Biscuit up. Let me rest, Biscuit said, still half asleep.

_Come on_, Cookie said, running around in circles as if she just had catnip. Wake up sleepy head! We have to go to Carmel Leaf to pick up some catnip and anti-worm pills.

Ok, just give me one more hour to sleep.

Hey, look its a big juicy bird, and its not even flying!

Biscuit woke up and his pupils became almost as big as his eyes. Where where?

It was just a trick to get you to stop sleeping. Now come!

Annoyed, Biscuit hissed and said, ok but NEVER joke about stuff like that, ok?

Cookie rolled her eyes, then said yeah yeah. Ok, lets go.

The two cats went to a huge calico with a scar on his paw. What do you want? The calico said grumpily.

Two anti worm pills and a medium size bag of catnip said Cookie a little scared.

Ok, that will be three clean mouses and two pigeons, said the grumpy calico.

Don't you think thats a lot just for 2 pills and catnip Carmel Leaf, Biscuit asked surprised.

Well its been getting harder to sneak in to those humans houses and sometimes, I get caught.

Well, we have to give him our emergency food, but I guess it's worth it Cookie said sadly.

A few minuets later they came back with there food and paid.

Alright, said Cookie. Lets go!

Wait, said Carmel Leaf. Are you going to the Dogan forest?

Yeah, Biscuit said sniffing the worm pills. So? Its not like theres monsters there.

Oh there is, Carmel Leaf said loudly. There's terrible monsters there. I myself have been in there and I almost died. I could hear a loud screeching sound and about 6 huge things bigger than dogs came pouncing at me. I barley escaped.

Biscuit could tell Cookie was scarred of Carmel Leafs story so he whispered to Cookie, don't worry Carmel Leaf is pretty old and makes up a lot of stuff. Remember when he said that he saw aliens take over the world?

That made Cookie feel better. After that they went to the Dogan forest but they heard something in a bush. Biscuit went a little closer to the bush but then something jumped out.
