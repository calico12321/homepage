<p>The Adventures of Cookie by Alder Breczinski</p>
<p>There once was a stray tuxedo cat in Gabrovo, Bulgaria. The cat's name was Cookie and her life was hard. She scavenged for food and water that was either dirty or had bugs in it.</p>
<p>But one day when she was sharing a piece of rotten mouse with her best friend Biscuit, who was an orange tom, Cookie said do you ever wonder where our parents are? Biscuit said no, I lost my mom when I saw a crow outside and when I came back my mom and siblings where gone. Oh said cookie. Well, I don't know how I lost my parents, but if I find them I can have a better life and I will have brothers and sisters. Doesn't that sound great to you?</p>
<p>Not really, we already have nice food and water and a shelter. Not really said cookie, spiting a piece of the mouse to the ground because there was a worm inside. We have bad food, dirty water and our shelter is under a car. I think we should go and try to find my parents and siblings.</p>
<p>No, I just want to stay here and sleep Biscuit said sleepily. And plus, we will be going into dog territory and we're at war with them so that won't be good.</p>
<p>Well, said cookie looking at a map a human dropped, we could try to go through the Dogan Forest up north.</p>
<p>WHAT! said biscuit are you crazy? Every animal that went in there never came back!</p>
<p>Exactly! said cookie excitedly, so there will be no dogs guarding it. I'm not so sure this is a good idea. How do we even know your family is past dog territory?</p>
<p>Because, I remember being chased out of my little nest by a huge dog and I could only see a big black and white cat saying: Run cookie run! we will meet again just run! And when we are in the Dogan Forest we can look at what the dogs are doing and after tell it to White Eye, the leader of the cats and we can live with him, all together. And he gets fresh mouse every day and the cleanest water and sometimes even milk! Cookie said even more exited. Wow said biscuit dreaming of all the snacks he would get.</p>
<p>OK, we should go first thing in the morning! But first we need sleep.</p>
<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>At ten in the morning, Cookie woke Biscuit up. Let me rest, Biscuit said, still half asleep.</p>
<p><em>Come on</em>, Cookie said, running around in circles as if she just had catnip. Wake up sleepy head! We have to go to Carmel Leaf to pick up some catnip and anti-worm pills.</p>
<p>Ok, just give me one more hour to sleep.</p>
<p>Hey, look its a big juicy bird, and its not even flying!</p>
<p>Biscuit woke up and his pupils became almost as big as his eyes. Where where?</p>
<p>It was just a trick to get you to stop sleeping. Now come!</p>
<p>Annoyed, Biscuit hissed and said, ok but NEVER joke about stuff like that, ok?</p>
<p>Cookie rolled her eyes, then said yeah yeah. Ok, lets go.</p>
<p>The two cats went to a huge calico with a scar on his paw. What do you want? The calico said grumpily.</p>
<p>Two anti worm pills and a medium size bag of catnip said Cookie a little scared.</p>
<p>Ok, that will be three clean mouses and two pigeons, said the grumpy calico.</p>
<p>Don't you think thats a lot just for 2 pills and catnip Carmel Leaf, Biscuit asked surprised.</p>
<p>Well its been getting harder to sneak in to those humans houses and sometimes, I get caught.</p>
<p>Well, we have to give him our emergency food, but I guess it's worth it Cookie said sadly.</p>
<p>A few minuets later they came back with there food and paid.</p>
<p>Alright, said Cookie. Lets go!</p>
<p>Wait, said Carmel Leaf. Are you going to the Dogan forest?</p>
<p>Yeah, Biscuit said sniffing the worm pills. So? Its not like theres monsters there.</p>
<p>Oh there is, Carmel Leaf said loudly. There's terrible monsters there. I myself have been in there and I almost died. I could hear a loud screeching sound and about 6 huge things bigger than dogs came pouncing at me. I barley escaped.</p>
<p>Biscuit could tell Cookie was scarred of Carmel Leafs story so he whispered to Cookie, don't worry Carmel Leaf is pretty old and makes up a lot of stuff. Remember when he said that he saw aliens take over the world?</p>
<p>That made Cookie feel better. After that they went to the Dogan forest but they heard something in a bush. Biscuit went a little closer to the bush but then something jumped out.</p>
<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Cookie and Biscuit both screamed.</p>
<p>Cookie jumped on to the animal and scratched, bit and hissed.</p>
<p>The animal threw Cookie off and growled. It was an Australian Shepard! It came closer and closer to Cookie and Biscuit.</p>
<p>Please don't hurt us Biscuit said. My friend did not mean to hurt you.</p>
<p>I did mean to hurt him Cookie said looking at the dog. I meant to do as much pain as i could.</p>
<p>Shhhh you're not helping Cookie, whispered Biscuit</p>
<p>Grrrr how dare you come in dog territory, growled the big dog.</p>
<p>I thought there where no dogs in the Dogan forest Biscuit said confused.</p>
<p>You're right growled the Dog, I was the king of the dog's hunter. But one day, I could not find any food, so as punishment I had to stay in the Dogan forest for a week. But now that I found you two kitty's, Lord Brown Ear will thank me, and I will be his hunter again.</p>
<p>We are not kitties hissed Cookie.</p>
<p>Just come here and I will take you to Death Cage the dog prison, the dog said still growling, follow me.</p>
<p>Cookie and Biscuit followed the huge dog out of the forest and to a huge black dog bigger than the Australian shepard.</p>
<p>Large Tail! I told you to come back after a week in the Dogan forest the huge dog said angrily.</p>
<p>But Brown Ear i brought intruders for you!</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em> of course you did. No cat would be dumb enough to go to the Dogan forest. Look after you spend a week in the forest you can be my hunter.</p>
<p>No its true look. The two cats came out of behind Large Tail's back.</p>
<p>Well look what we have here two cats walking in dog lands. Guards send them to the death cage. And Large Tail because you found them you can be the prison guard.</p>
<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>Two long dalmatians lead the two cats to a small metal cage filed with dirt and mud.</p>
<p>Get in here, one dalmatian growled.</p>
<p>Wait this is our cell? Cookie said when she and Biscuit went in the small cage.</p>
<p>This is horrible, Biscuit said. Im also hungry, he said grumpily.</p>
<p>Well we can have those worm pills, Cookie said looking at the cage, who knows what kind of stuff these dogs have. And the cage looks even worse than the dogs!</p>
<p>Both Cookie and Biscuit took a pill. These taste disgusting, Biscuit said.</p>
<p>Yea, Cookie said. We should also clean ourselves at least that does not taste disgusting.</p>
<p>After about 7 Minuit's of cleaning them selfs Cookie noticed that Large Tail was guarding the cage.</p>
<p>"Hey Large Tail! Cookie, said in a friendly voice, help us get out of here.</p>
<p>Hahahaha <em>yea</em> and get me sent to the Dogan forest for a year, Large tail said.</p>
<p>"But pleas Large Tail we want to find my mom cookie, said purring next to large Tail.</p>
<p>Look Australian shepard's are smart dogs and im not going to let you two cats escape.</p>
<p>Large Tail!!! the big brown dog was calling, Sorry kitties I need to do important business. Get some rest its late.</p>
<p>A few minuit's later Large Tail came to Brown ear. Yes Lord Brown Ear what do you need.</p>
<p>Oh nothing i just wanted to say that at eight in the morning your going to go back, Brown Ear said.</p>
<p>Go where? Large Tail said confused.</p>
<p>Back to the forest of course!</p>
<p>What!" Large Tail said mad, But i brought you prisoners!</p>
<p>Exactly! which is why you i reduced your punishment to 6 days not 7! Brown ear said haply.</p>
<p>No im not doing that!, Large Tail said furious</p>
<p>Brown Ear's smile went to a frown, ok if you don't want to go in the forest go in the death cage!</p>
<p>Sorry my Lord i should have never done that, Large Tail said still a little mad but holding it in.</p>
<p>Good now get some sleep Brown Ear, said calming down.</p>
<p>After that Large Tail went to the two cats in the death cage. Wake up, he said</p>
<p>Why? Biscuit said a little mad he was woken up.</p>
<p>We are going to get out of this place Large Tail said proudly</p>
<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5</h2>
<p>Cookie and Biscuit where both excited to hear that and were running around.</p>
<p>Shhhh Large Tail said, don't wake the dogs up!</p>
<p>Ok, said Cookie still excited. Whats the plan to escape?</p>
<p>So, in the morning, I say that you two are making weapons to destroy the dog army. After, Brown Ear opens the cage, I will distract him so you can escape. When you two run in to the Dogan forest, I will push Brown Ear in the cage and run away as fast as I can.</p>
<p>Great Cookie said and we brought catnip so me and Biscuit can run even more fast.</p>
<p>Ok guys yawned Biscuit but first we need some sleep.</p>
<p>I guess he is right said cookie also feeling sleepy. Good night Biscuit and Large Tail.</p>
<p>Well you guys can sleep but i will stay awake tonigh- ZZZZZZZ</p>
<p>Right in the morning Everybody woke up, Alright are you ready guys? Large Tail asked.</p>
<p>Yep Cookie and Biscuit said at the same time.</p>
<p>Ok im going to Brown Ear.</p>
<p>Large tail walked up to Brown Ear who was still a little bit sleeping.</p>
<p>I think our prisoners are making a weapon to destroy the dog army my Lord</p>
<p>Yea and they are probably going to make it out of dirt or something. I need to see this Brown Ear said laughing.</p>
<p>A few minuit's later they came to the death cage. Hello i heard you are making a weapon to destroy our army Brown Ear said wondering where it is.</p>
<p>Hey Brown Ear look over there another cat!Large tail said trying to distract him as good as he could.</p>
<p>Wait where? while Brown Ear was looking Biscuit and Cookie took a big sniff of catnip then ran as fast as they could.</p>
<p>Hey get back here Brown Ear said seeing them run away.</p>
<p>Before Brown Ear could chase them he was pushed in the death cage by Large Tail.</p>
<p>I will Get you cats and dog i will!!!</p>
<p>After they both made it to the Dogan forest Cookie and Biscuit and Cookie thanked Large Tail for helping them get out.</p>
<p>Hey Cookie said maybe you can come with us to find my family. And if you tell White Eye the Leader of the cats everything about the dogs he will be happy you are honest and you can live with him too!</p>
<p>Um ok Large Tail said</p>
<p>Hold on Biscuit said worried, Theres that thing Carmel Leaf was talking about.</p>
<p>Wait that huge huge thing Cookie said also scared. Its getting closer</p>
<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Hold on Large tail said staring at the huge animal approaching them, wait its red and orange but it has teeth.</p>
<p>Oh maybe it another cat Biscuit said trying not to be scared.</p>
<p>When i got about 8 meters away from them the animal ran as fast as is it could.</p>
<p>Its a fox!!!! Large Tail screamed, you two run away run away i will try to kill it!</p>
<p>Biscuit and Cookie ran as fast as they could going through bushes and plants, eventually Cookie and Biscuit went up a tree and watched Large tail fight the fox bellow.</p>
<p>Large Tail was growling and biting at the fox but it was to strong. Large Tail was struggling to keep fighting the fox.</p>
<p>We need to help him Biscuit! Cookie said worried.</p>
<p>Are you sure Cookie? That fox looks pretty dangerous!</p>
<p>We have to help Biscuit he saved us we need to save him now!</p>
<p>OK fine Biscuit said.</p>
<p>the two cats came from behind and grabbed on either side of the fox"s legs.</p>
<p>Ow!!! said the fox with great pain, get of me now!</p>
<p>Before he was done talking to the cats Large Tail jumped and bit him in the face very hard.</p>
<p>A few seconds later the bite must have been to hard for the fox because the fox soon fell on the ground and was dead.</p>
<p>Thanks for that Large tail said with scars on his face.</p>
<p>Well you did save us so now we saved you Cookie said licking dirt she got from the fox.</p>
<p>Hey do you know what this means? We finally have good food! Biscuit said so happy he could actually eat something that was not medicine.</p>
<p>The cats and dog feasted and ate the fox as fast as they ran away from the dog territory.</p>
<p>Well lets go to sleep now Large Tail said sleepily, and Cookie i think i might know here your parents are but i will tell you that in the morning ok?</p>
<p>Cookie was so exited that she could not sleep that night and only think about her Family.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night Cookie woke Large tail.</p>
<p>Lets go and find my Family Cookie said excitedly.</p>
<p>Wake me up in the morning Cookie. Large Tail yawned</p>
<p>But it is morning Cookie said, the middle of the night is morning.</p>
<p>Uhg just wake me up at twelve or ten or something.</p>
<p>Ok cookie said, well its twelve right now.</p>
<p>Twelve in the Morning! Large Tail said annoyed.</p>
<p>It is the morning! Cookie said.</p>
<p>Ok if i tell you where your parents might be will you let me sleep? Large Tail said trying to sleep.</p>
<p>Yes yes yes!!!!! Cookie said so exited you would think she just had a big sniff of catnip.</p>
<p>Ok when i worked for Brown Ear we found out a group of tuxedo cats and there parents where living in out territory so Brown Ear sent a Huge dog to chase them away.</p>
<p>Thats what the dog was! Cookie interrupted.</p>
<p>Anyways all of the cts in the Family well except you ran off to a different land way past Gabrovo. The cats ran and ran for months until they came to Ramenia no thats not it Rockmenia Oh! Romania! That was it anyways they now have a ne home there.</p>
<p>Ok Cookie said but how do we get there?</p>
<p>Oh i was thinking taking a helicopter Large Tail said</p>
<p>What!!! i cant believe it i cant wait for tomorrow or actually today because its morning. Cookie said now a tiny bit tired.</p>
<p>Ok said Large Tail well lets get back to slee- ZZZZZZZZZ</p>
<h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7</h2>
<p>In the morning Cookie and Large Tail woke up at the same time they tried to wake Biscuit up but as usual Biscuit just wanted to sleep.</p>
<p>Pleas let me sleep for longer, Biscuit said lazily.</p>
<p>Does he always do this? Large Tail said.</p>
<p>Yep Biscuit is pretty lazy. Cookie said cleaning herself.</p>
<p>Well look at this Large Tail said excitedly, Large Tail barked as loud as he could and everyone in the forest could here it.</p>
<p>Biscuit woke up and hissed a lot at Large Tail, Why did you do that Biscuit said vert angry.</p>
<p>Well we have to get going if we want to cath the Helicopter.</p>
<p>What is a helicopter? Biscuit asked.</p>
<p>Oh its like this big metal bird humans fly. Cookie said ready to go.</p>
<p>Oh those things Biscuit said now knowing what a helicopter is, well how do we get on one of those things and none of us know how to control one of those things.</p>
<p>True said Large Tail, but i know how we will get on it.</p>
<p>How? Cookie and Biscuit asked surprised.</p>
<p>Well you know that American show called worlds cutest animals? Asked Large Tail.</p>
<p>Yea Biscuit said, I love it i usually watch it at those tv sores here.</p>
<p>Well if we keep going through the Dogan forest and i bark like that we will get there attention because they almost always look in there for animals and when they find us and put us in the helicopter to America we break out of the bags they put us in then steer the helicopter to Romania Large tail said.</p>
<p>But we don't know how do fly a helicopter Biscuit said.</p>
<p>Yes thats true but i know how to get to Romania it borders our land by a river so we just have to find a river when flying the helicopter.</p>
<p>Yea said Biscuit wanting to go back to sleep, so according to you there i only one river in the world.</p>
<p>No the river will look different and there will be a sign Large Tail said.</p>
<p>Well how do we see the s- before Biscuit could finish his sentence he saw 2 humans with 3 big bags with air holes.</p>
<p>Look Large Tail said its the humans just pretend you want to go in the bag ok.</p>
<p>Got it Cookie said willing to do anything to see her Family.</p>
<p>about 30 minuit's later they were in the helicopter high in the sky.</p>
<p>Ok large Tail said, when i say GO we all jump out of these bags and attack the humans. Ok?</p>
<p>yep Cookie and Biscuit said.</p>
<p>Ok then large Tail said, 3…2…1… GO!!!</p>
<p>The two cats and one dog jumped and destroyed the bag Biscuit attacked the first human who was flying the Helicopter Biscuit and Cookie where biting the second human.</p>
<p>Eventually they knocked the humans on the ground and could here them screaming.</p>
<p>Cookie shouted i will steer it to Romania you two keep the humans on the ground!</p>
<p>When Cookie had control of the helicopter she could not steer it she did not know what any of it meat so she asked Large tail what to do.</p>
<p>Large Tail who was still trying to keep the human on the ground told Cookie to try to move the stick on it.</p>
<p>When Cookie did it she moved the helicopter to the right then left then somehow turned it upside down. After a few hours the Helicopter was going in random directions and now it was going down.</p>
<p>Look Cookie said! its the river and the sign we are in Romania.</p>
<p>Good said Large Tail but we are going to crash in to the river!</p>
<h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8</h2>
<p>SPLASH!!! The humans cats and dog landed in the river and were being pulled away.</p>
<p>Quick! Large Tail screamed, we can float in that piece of wood!</p>
<p>Biscuit landed right next to Large Tail so he swam easily to the piece of wood there.</p>
<p>The humans swam easily to the helicopter that was sinking.</p>
<p>Cookie was to far away from anything to swim there Cookie was calling for help screaming yelling but nobody could help her she was to far away. Cookie was drowning in the water she tried to get back up but she could not.</p>
<p>Eventually she got too tired and could not breath she closed her eyes and when she opened them again she could breath perfectly she was floating back up to the surface and when she was out of the water she saw Biscuit and Large Tail now in Romania, wondering where Cookie was.</p>
<p>Cookie screamed Im here guys look!</p>
<p>but they did not hear her or seem to see her when Cookie was in the clouds she was sucked three times the speed of sound to the sun.</p>
<p>Cookie knew she could not breath in space but just like in the water she could breath fine.</p>
<p>When Cookie finally reached the sun and was not felling even a tiny burn, she was sucked in the sun.</p>
<p>Cookie saw a huge black cat bigger than a house.</p>
<p>Cookie also saw cats playing, getting clean yummy food, sleeping and having a good time.</p>
<p>Where am? i Cookie asked confused to the huge black cat.</p>
<p>I am Huge Fur the god of the white star.</p>
<p>What is the white star? Cookie asked even more confused.</p>
<p>The white star is the place cats go after they die. It is meant to be relaxing and a paradise for cats Huge fur said.</p>
<p>But i cant be dead i need to find my parents now! Cookie said.</p>
<p>Im sorry little one but here you can relax, play, and get the best food!</p>
<p>Cookie went away and sat still eating a delicious crow but still feeling sad.</p>
<p>A few minuit's later a calico about Cookie's size came to her.</p>
<p>Whats the mater? the calico asked.</p>
<p>Cookie explained everything to her.</p>
<p>Oh said the calico well you can get back down to earth if you want.</p>
<p>How! Cookie asked excitedly.</p>
<p>Well if you only died one time then that means you still have 8 more lives and you can go back to earth the calico said.</p>
<p>Really? thank you so much you should come with us to find my parents! maybe White Eye will even let you live with him too!</p>
<p>Well i would love that the calico said, but i used all of my lives and no one wants to give me there life.</p>
<p>Well you can have one of my life's Cookie said happily.</p>
<p>You would do that thank you so much! whats your name? The calico asked.</p>
<p>My name is Cookie how about you?</p>
<p>my name is Pebbles.</p>
<p>Oh thats a nice name Cookie said anyways lets go back to earth!</p>
<p>The two cats went to Huge Fur and explained everything.</p>
<p>Very well Huge Fur said then sent the 2 cats to Romania where the cat and dog where waiting.</p>
<p>Cookie! Biscuit and Large Tail said, i thought you where dead Biscuit said.</p>
<p>And who is thi? Large Tail said pointing to Pebbles</p>
<p>So Cookie explained everything and when she was done talking she saw some tuxedo cats she went a little closer she noticed it was her parents.</p>
<h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Cookie and the rest ran to the calico cats as fast as they could.</p>
<p>Cookie hugged all of them and said, im so happy to see you!!!</p>
<p>Cookie we have missed! you one of the small tuxedos said.</p>
<p>Cookie told her family abut her adventures and how they met Pebbles and Large Tail and Biscuit.</p>
<p>That sounds wonderful Cookies mom said, but your older brother Odepo is unfortunately adopted by a human.</p>
<p>I had people adopt me too! Pebbles said.</p>
<p>But these people are much worse Cookies mom said. They don't let him go outside they don't give him any fresh food or freedom.</p>
<p>Well we will free Odepo! Cookie said strongly.</p>
<p>Im not so sure thats a good idea Cookie's mom said, those humans have security cameras so they can cath us!</p>
<p>Well why don't we do it at night Pebbles said, I always snuck out at night and went to the little river to get fish.</p>
<p>But this is harder than getting fish one of The tuxedo cats said.</p>
<p>Still we have to try Cookie said! Ok heres the plan. Large Tail will create a distraction by barking loudly. Biscuit and me will go through the back window and Pebbles will jump on the cameras ans try to destroy each of them one by one. My and Biscuit will find Odepo and bring him back!</p>
<p>And what do we do? the tuxedo cats asked.</p>
<p>If the humans notice us then all of you bight them as hard as you can ok!!! Cookie said.</p>
<p>Ok the tuxedo cats said.</p>
<p>3..2..1… lets go! Hold on Cookie said, where is the house?</p></main></html>
